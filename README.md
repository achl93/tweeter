# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The original forked repository contains the starter code for this project. To complete this app, I utilized various front-end skills and technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery & AJAX while also implementing new features in the back-end which consisted of Node, Express and MongoDB.

## Stretch features
- Rewrote styles in SASS
